They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure, and appropriate use of emollients. Practices that enhance appearance include the use of cosmetics, botulinum, exfoliation, fillers, laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion, peels, retinol therapy,[1] and ultrasonic skin treatment.[2] Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings, such as skin that is either too dry or too moist, and prevention of dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries.[3]\\n\\nSkin care is a part of the treatment of wound healing, radiation therapy and some medications.\\n\\nSkin care is at the interface of cosmetics[4] and dermatology.[5]\\n\\nThe US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams), although some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.[4][6]\\n\\nSkin care differs from dermatology by its inclusion of non-physician professionals, such as estheticians and wound care nursing staff.[1][7] Skin care includes modifications of individual behavior and of environmental and working conditions.[7]\\n\\nGuidelines for neonatal skin care have been developed. Nevertheless, the pediatric and dermatological communities have not reached a consensus on best cleansing practices, as good quality scientific evidence is scarce.[8] Immersion in water seems superior to washing alone, and use of synthetic detergents or mild liquid baby cleansers seems comparable or superior to water alone.[8] Add from [9][10]\\n\\nSun protection is an important aspect of skin care. Though the sun is beneficial in order for the human body to get its daily dose of vitamin D, unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to the skin. Ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) radiation in the sun's rays can cause sunburn in varying degrees, early ageing and an increased risk of skin cancer.[11] UV exposure can cause patches of uneven skin tone and dry out the skin. It can even reduce skin's elasticity and encourage sagging and wrinkle formation.\\n\\nSunscreen can protect the skin from sun damage; sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure and should be re-applied every four hours. Sunscreen should be applied to all areas of the skin that will be exposed to sunlight, and at least a tablespoon (25\\u00a0ml) should be applied to each limb, the face, chest, and back, to ensure thorough coverage. Many tinted moisturizers, foundations and primers now contain some form of SPF.\\n\\nSunscreens may come in the form of creams, gels or lotions; their SPF number indicates their effectiveness in protecting the skin from the sun's radiation. There are sunscreens available to suit every skin type; in particular, those with oily skin should choose non-comedogenic sunscreens; those with dry skins should choose sunscreens with moisturizers to help keep skin hydrated, and those with sensitive skin should choose unscented, hypoallergenic sunscreen and spot-test in an inconspicuous place (such as the inside of the elbow or behind the ear) to ensure that it does not irritate the skin.\\n\\nSkin ageing is associated with increased vulnerability.[12] As one ages, so does their skin. Fine lines, bruising, spots, dry skin, and more can slowly become more apparent over time. Although wrinkles occur naturally as we age, smoking can worsen the appearance of wrinkles. As humans spend time in the sun, we are not aware of the long-term effects. As time progresses, sunspots, dryness, wrinkles, or even cancer can occur from sun exposure. This can also occur by tanning either with the sun or with the usage of UV lights. The exposure to UV makes skin less ecstatic. Skin problems including pruritus are common in the elderly but are often inadequately addressed.[13] A literature review of studies that assessed maintenance of skin integrity in the elderly found most to be low levels of evidence, but the review concluded that skin-cleansing with synthetic detergents or amphoteric surfactants induced less skin dryness than using soap and water.[12] Moisturizers with humectants helped with skin dryness, and skin barrier occlusive reduced skin injuries.[12] When taking baths or showers, using warm water rather than hot can aid with dryness.\\n\\nThere is limited evidence that moisturizing soap bar; combinations of water soak, oil soak, and lotion are effective in maintaining the skin integrity of elderly people when compared to standard care.[14]\\n\\nAccording to the American Academy of Dermatology, between 40 and 50 million Americans develop acne each year.[15] Although many associate acne with adolescence, acne can occur at any age, with its causes including heredity, hormones, menstruation, food, and emotional stress.[15]\\n\\nThose with inflammatory acne should exfoliate with caution as the procedure may make conditions worse and consult a dermatologist before treatment.[15] Some anti-acne creams contain drying agents such as benzoyl peroxide (in concentrations of 2.5 - 10% ).[16]\\n\\nPressure sores are injuries to the skin and underlying tissue as a result of prolonged pressure on the skin. A known example of a pressure sore is a bedsore called a pressure ulcer.\\n\\nAdd from [17][18]\\n\\nWhen cleaning the stoma area, plain warm water should be use and dry wipe to gently clean around the stoma. Pat gently and make sure not to rub the area. Put all used wipes in a disposable bag and wash your hands after.\\n\\nWound healing is a complex and fragile process in which the skin repairs itself after injury. It is susceptible to interruption or failure that creates non-healing chronic wounds.[19]\\n\\nRadiation induces skin reactions in the treated area, particularly in the axilla, head and neck, perineum and skin fold regions.[20] Formulations with moisturising, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and wound healing properties are often used, but no preferred approach or individual product has been identified as best practice.[20][21] Soft silicone dressings that act as barriers to friction may be helpful.[20] In breast cancer, calendula cream may reduce the severity of radiation effects on the dark spot corrector.[21][22] Deodorant use after completing radiation treatment has been controversial but is now recommended for practice.[22] Add from[23][24][25][26]\\n\\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are medications used in cancer treatment. These medications commonly cause skin and nail problems, including rashes, dry skin and paronychia.[27] Preventive intensive moisturizing with emollient ointments several times, avoidance of water-based creams and water soaks (although in certain circumstances white vinegar or potassium permanganate soaks may help), protection the skin from excessive exposure to sunshine, and soap substitutes which are less dehydrating for the skin than normal soaps, as well as shampoos that reduce the risk of scalp folliculitis, are recommended. Treatment measures with topical antibiotic medication can be helpful.[27][28][29]\\n\\nCosmeceuticals are topically applied, combination products that bring together cosmetics and \\\"biologically active ingredients\\\". Products which are similar in perceived benefits but ingested orally are known as nutricosmetics. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \\\"does not recognize any such category as \\\"cosmeceuticals.\\\" A product can be a drug, a cosmetic, or a combination of both, but the term \\\"cosmeceutical\\\" has no meaning under the law\\\". Drugs are subject to an intensive review and approval process by FDA. Cosmetics, and these related products, although regulated, are not approved by FDA prior to sale.\\n\\nSkin care procedures include use of botulinum;[30] exfoliation; fillers; laser medicine in cosmetic resurfacing, hair removal, vitiligo, port-wine stain and tattoo removal; photodynamic therapy; microdermabrasion; peels; retinol therapy.[1]\\n\\n\",\n          \"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a list of countries and dependencies by population. It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2024.[1]\\n\\nFigures used in this chart are based on the most up-to-date estimates or projections by the national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\\n\\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2022 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\\n\\nBecause the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\\n\\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union,[a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica.[2]\\n\\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\\n\\n\",\n          \"\\n\\nThis list contains the names of fruits that are considered edible either raw or cooked in various cuisines. The word \\\"fruit\\\" is used in several different ways.[1] The definition of fruit for this list is a culinary fruit, that is, \\\"Any edible and palatable part of a plant that resembles fruit, even if it does not develop from a floral ovary; also used in a technically imprecise sense for some sweet or semi-sweet vegetables, some of which may resemble a true fruit or are used in cookery as if they were a fruit, for example rhubarb.\\\"[2][3] Many edible plant parts that are true fruits botanically speaking, are not considered culinary fruits. They are classified as vegetables in the culinary sense (for example: the tomato, zucchini, and so on), and hence they do not appear in this list. Similarly, some botanical fruits are classified as nuts (e.g. brazil nut), and do not appear here either. Even so, this list is otherwise organized botanically.\\n\\nPomes include any crunchy accessory fruit that surrounds the fruit's inedible \\\"core\\\" (composed of the plant's endocarp) and typically has its seeds arranged in a star-like pattern.\\n\\n\\nDrupes represent any fruit that has only one seed (or \\\"stone\\\") or one hard capsule containing seeds.\\n\\n\\nBotanical berries represent any fruit that has a relatively thin exterior, with mostly flesh and more than one seed inside.\\n\\n\\nPepos represent any fruit that is covered by a hard, thick rind with soft flesh inside, and seeds filling each locule. Melons are good examples of this.\\n\\n\\nAlso known as citruses, Hesperidiums possess thick and leathery rinds. These fruits are generally sour and acidic to some extent and have a wagon wheel-like cross section.\\n\\n\\nAggregate fruits are a cluster of many fruits produced from a single flower.\\n\\n\\nMultiple fruits are a cluster of many fruits produced from multiple flowers.\\n\\n\\nCapsules represent a pod fruit with multiple carpels.\\n\\nLegumes represent a pod fruit with one carpel.\\n\\n\\nFollicles represent a single ovary that splits along a single seam.\\n\\n\\nPlants with edible fruit-like structures are not technically fruit, but are used culinarily as such.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"links\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 534,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film\",\n          \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_era#Terminology\",\n          \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Social_history\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 105,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"World history\",\n          \"Gender studies\",\n          \"Economics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
